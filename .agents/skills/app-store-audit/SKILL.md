# 🔥 ADVANCED RULES — Edge Cases & Silent Killers

> These are the rules most developers don't know about. They cause "surprise rejections" that seem random but are actually predictable.

## 12. Reviewer Access & Experience (Silent Killer)

Apple & Google reviewers test from different devices, regions, and accounts. If they can't access your full app in 30 seconds → rejection.

| ID | Severity | Rule | What to Check |
|----|----------|------|---------------|
| `ADV-REV-001` | 🔴 | **Test account MUST be provided** | If login required, provide working credentials in review notes |
| `ADV-REV-002` | 🔴 | **OTP/2FA must work for test account** | If using OTP, provide a bypass or static code |
| `ADV-REV-003` | 🔴 | **Geo-restricted features must be accessible** | If features are country-locked, provide demo mode or VPN instructions |
| `ADV-REV-004` | 🔴 | **First 30 seconds must work perfectly** | Reviewer forms opinion in first 30 seconds. Splash → Home must be flawless |
| `ADV-REV-005` | 🟡 | **Clear reviewer notes** | Explain non-obvious features, navigation paths, special requirements |

---

## 13. External Hardware & Dependencies

| ID | Severity | Rule | What to Check |
|----|----------|------|---------------|
| `ADV-HW-001` | 🔴 | **Hardware-dependent features need demo mode** | If app needs Bluetooth device, IoT, car system → provide simulation/demo |
| `ADV-HW-002` | 🟡 | **Video proof for hardware features** | Record video showing hardware features working, attach to review notes |
| `ADV-HW-003` | 🔴 | **App must be usable without hardware** | Core experience should work even without connected device |

---

## 14. Push Notifications & Background Activity

| ID | Severity | Rule | What to Check |
|----|----------|------|---------------|
| `ADV-PUSH-001` | 🔴 | **No spam notifications** | Don't send excessive promotional push notifications |
| `ADV-PUSH-002` | 🔴 | **No promotional push without consent** | Must get user permission before marketing notifications |
| `ADV-PUSH-003` | 🔴 | **No misleading alerts** | Push content must match what user sees when opening |
| `ADV-BG-001` | 🔴 | **No unnecessary background services** | Don't run services that aren't needed |
| `ADV-BG-002` | 🔴 | **No background tracking without reason** | Location/activity tracking must have visible purpose |
| `ADV-BG-003` | 🟡 | **No excessive battery drain** | Test battery usage with profiling tools |

---

## 15. Account & Data Deletion — BOTH PLATFORMS (Most Common Rejection)

> **This is the #1 most common "surprise rejection" for apps with login/signup.** Both Apple and Google strictly enforce this. Apple requires in-app deletion since 2022. Google requires BOTH in-app AND a web deletion URL. Getting this wrong = instant rejection on Apple, app removal on Google.

| ID | Severity | Rule | What to Check |
|----|----------|------|---------------|
| `ADV-ACCT-001` | 🔴 | **Account deletion MUST exist in-app** | Both Apple & Google: if users create accounts, deletion must be available inside the app. No exceptions |
| `ADV-ACCT-002` | 🔴 | **Deletion must ACTUALLY delete data** | Don't just deactivate/disable — server must delete personal data from ALL databases and services |
| `ADV-ACCT-003` | 🔴 | **Apple: Revoke Sign in with Apple tokens** | If using SIWA, MUST call Apple REST API to revoke refresh tokens on account deletion |
| `ADV-ACCT-004` | 🔴 | **Google: Web-based deletion URL required** | Must provide a web link in Data Safety form where users can request deletion WITHOUT reinstalling the app |
| `ADV-ACCT-005` | 🔴 | **Must not require contacting support** | No "email us" or "call us" or "fill a form on website" to delete — must be self-service in-app |
| `ADV-ACCT-006` | 🔴 | **Easy to find in UI** | Delete button must be in Settings or Profile screen — not hidden in sub-sub-menus |
| `ADV-ACCT-007` | 🔴 | **Must delete from ALL third-party services** | Remove data from analytics, crash reporting, marketing, CRM, cloud storage — everything |
| `ADV-ACCT-008` | 🟡 | **Confirmation before deletion** | Must have confirmation step ("Are you sure?") to prevent accidental deletion |
| `ADV-ACCT-009` | 🟡 | **Explain what gets deleted** | Warn about loss of purchases, data, history, and subscriptions before confirming |
| `ADV-ACCT-010` | 🟡 | **Handle active subscriptions** | Cancel or clearly notify user about active subscriptions before account deletion |
| `ADV-ACCT-011` | 🟡 | **Data retention disclosure** | If any data retained (fraud prevention, legal compliance), clearly state what and why |
| `ADV-ACCT-012` | 🟡 | **Send deletion confirmation** | Email/notify user confirming their account and data have been permanently deleted |

**Complete Account Deletion Implementation Guide (Apple + Google):**
```
CLIENT SIDE (Both Platforms):
├── Settings/Profile → "Delete Account" button (easily visible, not hidden)
├── Confirmation screen → clearly explain what will be deleted
├── Re-authenticate user (password, biometrics, or OTP) before deletion
├── Show loading/progress state during deletion
├── Clear ALL local data (cache, tokens, preferences, saved files)
├── Redirect to login/welcome screen after deletion
└── Show success message confirming deletion

SERVER SIDE (Both Platforms):
├── Delete user record from main database
├── Delete all user-generated content (posts, messages, photos, videos)
├── Delete uploaded files from cloud storage (S3, GCS, Firebase Storage)

├── Cancel active subscriptions OR notify user they must cancel
├── Send deletion confirmation email
└── Log deletion event for compliance audit trail ONLY

WEB DELETION PAGE (Google Play REQUIRED):
├── Create accessible page at yourdomain.com/delete-account
├── User enters email or phone to identify their account
├── Send verification code (email OTP or SMS)
├── After verification, process deletion same as in-app
├── Show confirmation that deletion request was received
└── Add this URL in Play Console → Data Safety → "Data deletion" section

APPLE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
├── Sign in with Apple → revoke tokens via REST API:
│   POST https://appleid.apple.com/auth/revoke
│   Parameters: client_id, client_secret, token, token_type_hint
├── Must work even if user signed up via SIWA with hidden email
├── Must handle relay email addresses (@privaterelay.appleid.com)
└── Deletion must be available WITHOUT requiring the user to contact support
```

## 16. Ads Implementation

| ID | Severity | Rule | What to Check |
|----|----------|------|---------------|
| `ADV-ADS-001` | 🔴 | **Ads must not cover UI** | No full-screen ads blocking essential navigation |
| `ADV-ADS-002` | 🔴 | **No accidental ad triggers** | Ads must not appear where users accidentally tap them |
| `ADV-ADS-003` | 🔴 | **No ads before app loads** | Don't show interstitial before user sees home screen |

| `ADV-ADS-005` | 🟡 | **Ads appropriate for content rating** | Ads must match app's age rating |

---

## 17. Fake Engagement & Manipulation

| ID | Severity | Rule | What to Check |
|----|----------|------|---------------|
| `ADV-ENGAGE-001` | 🔴 | **No fake ratings system** | Don't manipulate or fake review scores |
| `ADV-ENGAGE-002` | 🔴 | **No rewarding users for reviews** | Don't give coins/rewards for App Store reviews |
| `ADV-ENGAGE-003` | 🔴 | **No incentivized installs** | Don't pay users to install or rate the app |

---

## 18. Localization & Language

| ID | Severity | Rule | What to Check |
|----|----------|------|---------------|
| `ADV-LOC-001` | 🟡 | **No mixed languages in UI** | If app is English, everything must be English (no random Arabic/Chinese) |
| `ADV-LOC-002` | 🟡 | **No broken translations** | If localized, verify all strings are translated correctly |
| `ADV-LOC-003` | 🟡 | **Store listing language must match** | App Store language = app language |

---

## 19. Accessibility (Increasingly Important)

| ID | Severity | Rule | What to Check |
|----|----------|------|---------------|
| `ADV-A11Y-001` | 🟡 | **Support screen readers** | VoiceOver (iOS) / TalkBack (Android) should work |
| `ADV-A11Y-002` | 🟡 | **Support dynamic text sizes** | UI should adapt to system font size settings |
| `ADV-A11Y-003` | 🟡 | **Sufficient color contrast** | Text must be readable (WCAG AA minimum) |

---

| `ADV-VER-001` | 🔴 | **Updates must not break existing features** | Don't remove features existing users depend on |
| `ADV-VER-002` | 🔴 | **Unstable backend = rejection** | If server is down during review → rejected |
| `ADV-VER-003` | 🟡 | **Don't use beta/unstable APIs** | Backend must be stable during review period |

---

## 21. Hidden Paywall Traps

| ID | Severity | Rule | What to Check |
|----|----------|------|---------------|
| `ADV-PAYWALL-001` | 🔴 | **No hidden paid features** | Don't make features look free then suddenly ask payment |
| `ADV-PAYWALL-002` | 🔴 | **Free app must offer real value** | If freemium, free tier must be actually useful |
| `ADV-PAYWALL-003` | 🟡 | **Clear pricing before purchase** | User must know exact price before any payment action |

# 🧠 THE 4 LAYERS OF REJECTION

> **Pro insight:** Most developers only fix Layer 1 and get rejected again. You must pass ALL 4 layers.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 4: TRUST                     │
│  Privacy, transparency, honesty     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 3: EXPERIENCE                │
│  UI/UX quality, design, polish      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 2: POLICY                    │
│  Rules, permissions, billing        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 1: TECHNICAL                 │
│  Bugs, crashes, performance         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Layer | What Reviewers Check | Common Mistake |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Technical** | Does it crash? Does it work? | Devs fix this and think they're done |
| **Policy** | Does it follow the rules? | Devs don't read guidelines |
| **Experience** | Is it good to use? | Devs ignore polish and UX |
| **Trust** | Is it honest and transparent? | Devs hide limitations |

> **The hidden truth:** Many rejections happen because the reviewer had a **bad experience in the first 30 seconds** — couldn't login, didn't understand the app, feature didn't work instantly. It's not always about complex rules.

# 🤖 AI AGENT AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 0: Detect Framework
Before scanning, identify which framework the project uses:

| Indicator File | Framework |
|---|---|
| `pubspec.yaml` | **Flutter** (Dart) |
| `package.json` + `react-native` dep | **React Native** (JS/TS) |
| `*.xcodeproj` + `*.swift` files only | **Native iOS** (Swift / SwiftUI) |
| `build.gradle.kts` + `*.kt` + no `pubspec.yaml` | **Native Android** (Kotlin / Jetpack Compose) |
| `build.gradle` + `*.java` files | **Native Android** (Java) |
| `shared/` + `androidApp/` + `iosApp/` | **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** |
| `*.csproj` + `*.xaml` | **Xamarin / .NET MAUI** |

### Step 1: Identify App Type
- Free, paid, or subscription?
- Has login/accounts?
- Streams media?
- Has user-generated content?
- Which platforms? (iOS / Android / Both)
- Requires external hardware?
- Has ads?
- **Which framework?** (detected in Step 0)

### Step 2: Scan These Files

Scan the files relevant to the detected framework. Always scan the **Common** and **Platform Config** files, then scan the framework-specific source files.

#### Common (All Frameworks)
```
ios/Info.plist                    → Permissions, encryption flags
ios/**/Info.plist                  → (may be nested differently per framework)
android/**/AndroidManifest.xml    → Permissions, queries, debuggable flag
```

#### Platform Config by Framework

**Flutter:**
```
pubspec.yaml                      → Version, dependencies
ios/Runner.xcodeproj/             → SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS, DEVICE_FAMILY
android/app/build.gradle           → targetSdk, versionCode, arm64
```

**React Native:**
```
package.json                      → Version, dependencies

*.entitlements                    → Capabilities (IAP, push, etc.)
```

**Native Android (Kotlin / Java / Jetpack Compose):**
```
build.gradle / build.gradle.kts   → targetSdk, versionCode, dependencies
gradle.properties                 → Build config flags
proguard-rules.pro                → Obfuscation rules
```

**Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP):**
```
shared/build.gradle.kts           → Shared module config
androidApp/build.gradle.kts       → Android target config
iosApp/*.xcodeproj                → iOS target config
gradle.properties                 → Build flags
```

**Xamarin / .NET MAUI:**
```

### Step 3: Check Every Rule
For each rule in this document:
1. Search the codebase for relevant patterns
2. Flag any violations with the Rule ID and severity
3. Provide the exact file path and line number
4. Write a clear, step-by-step fix instruction the developer can follow immediately

### Step 4: Generate the Audit Report

**IMPORTANT:** The report is the most critical output. It must be professional, clear, and actionable. The developer should be able to read the report and fix every issue without asking follow-up questions.

Use this EXACT format:

```markdown
# 🛡️ App Store Audit Report

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **App** | [App Name] |
| **Version** | [Version + Build Number] |
| **Platforms** | iOS / Android / Both |
