## 💡 Why This Exists

Every mobile developer has been there:

> You spend days polishing your app → upload to the store → wait 24-48 hours → **REJECTED.**
> Fix one issue → resubmit → wait again → **REJECTED for something else.**
> Repeat until you question your career choices.

**This skill was born from real rejections.** It's a comprehensive ruleset that teaches AI coding assistants to audit your app *before* you submit — catching the same issues Apple and Google reviewers look for.

> **Framework-agnostic:** App Store and Play Store reviewers don't care if you built with Flutter, React Native, Swift, or Kotlin. A rejection is a rejection. This skill works with **any** mobile framework.

### What It Catches

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Add to Your Project

Copy the `app-store-audit-skill/` folder to your project root:

**Flutter:**
```
your-flutter-project/
├── app-store-audit-skill/
│   ├── README.md          ← You're reading this
│   └── AUDIT_SKILL.md     ← The audit rules (the AI reads this)
├── lib/
├── pubspec.yaml
└── ...
```

**React Native:**
```
your-rn-project/
├── app-store-audit-skill/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── AUDIT_SKILL.md
├── src/
├── package.json
└── ...
```

**Native iOS (Swift / SwiftUI):**
```
your-ios-project/
├── app-store-audit-skill/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── AUDIT_SKILL.md
├── MyApp/
├── MyApp.xcodeproj
└── ...
```

**Native Android (Kotlin / Java / Jetpack Compose):**
```
your-android-project/
├── app-store-audit-skill/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── AUDIT_SKILL.md
├── app/src/main/
├── build.gradle.kts
└── ...
```

**KMP (Kotlin Multiplatform):**
```
your-kmp-project/
├── app-store-audit-skill/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── AUDIT_SKILL.md
├── shared/
├── androidApp/
├── iosApp/
└── ...
```

### Step 2: Run the Audit

Open your AI coding assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, etc.) and ask:

```
Audit my app for App Store and Play Store rejection risks.
Use the audit skill in app-store-audit-skill/AUDIT_SKILL.md
```

Or be more specific:

```
I'm about to submit my iOS app to the App Store.
Read app-store-audit-skill/AUDIT_SKILL.md and audit my codebase for rejection risks.
Focus on payments and subscription compliance.
```

### Step 3: Review the Report

The AI will generate a report like this:

```
🛡️ App Store Audit Report

App: My Awesome App
Version: 2.1.0
Platforms: iOS, Android

🔴 Critical Issues (Will Cause Rejection)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. [AAPL-3.1.1-001] Custom promo code field found on paywall
   → File: lib/views/paywall.dart:142
   → Fix: Remove promo code field from iOS. Use Apple Offer Codes instead.

2. [AAPL-3.1.2-001] Missing "Restore Purchases" button
   → File: lib/views/paywall.dart
   → Fix: Add a Restore Purchases button on the subscription screen.

🟡 Warnings (May Cause Rejection)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. [AAPL-META-002] Version "2.0.0" shown in Profile doesn't match
   pubspec.yaml version "2.1.0"
   → File: lib/views/profile.dart:89

✅ Passed: Privacy, Content, UI, Performance
```

### Step 4: Fix & Submit

Fix the flagged issues, then submit with confidence! 🚀
